# Google-Data-Analytics-Professional-Certificate

The first repository contains my certificate of completion for my first course in the Google Data Analytis course, Foundations: Data, data everywhere. 

The second repository contains my first lab of the course. In this lab I had to analyze a data set of ice cream sales and answer three questions pertaining to the data. You can read a deeper explanation of the lab once you click on it.
